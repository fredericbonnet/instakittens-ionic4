/*
 * World object support for CodeceptJS.
 *
 * World objects are used by CucumberJS to share state between steps. The
 * documentation states:
 *
 * https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js/blob/master/docs/support_files/world.md
 *
 * > *World* is an isolated context for each scenario, exposed to the hooks and
 * > steps as *this*.
 *
 * The CodeceptJS Cucumber implementation has no native support for world object
 * and provides no means of sharing state between steps. However we can emulate
 * this behavior using the Helper API.
